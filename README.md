### 5x12 ortholinear keyboard switch plate for use with Alps switches.
* Inspired by the layout of the AMJ-40 keyboard, with an additional row for number keys.

* Kit works really well with an AEK-II, you can achieve a decent hacked together profile as pictured at the top.

* Bottom row intended to have a 2.75u spacebar and an adjacent 1.25u 3rd layer key.
* Spacerbar stabilizer mounting holes are designed for Alps OEM stabilizer not Cherry MX style stabs.
    * The spacebar can be mounted flipped, or normally.


### Assembly:
* The plate and case are intended to be joined with small screws, however, there are no holes in the parts. Feel free to add this but I chose to make them manually.
* The rear cutout is designed for a mini usb connection, like the one on the Teensy2.0.


### Note:
* Case cad files contain supports that will need to be trimmed off after printing, feel free to remove them if you want to print without them.
* Switch fitment is very tight when the plate is 3D printed at 2mm thickness. Trimming was definitely required in my case.
* Zero fitment guarantee, in fact, I guarantee you will have to fine tune the fit if printing.
* STL files may be misoriented for printing, thoroughly inspect files before continuing to print.


### To-do:
* Default amj-40 style keymap will be added once I finish handwiring the prototype.

###### Model was created in Solidworks, then exported as STL/DXF. Feel free to use/modify/redistribute.
